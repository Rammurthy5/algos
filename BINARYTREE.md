A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

types:
Full Binary Tree: Every node other than the leaves has two children.
Complete Binary Tree: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
Perfect Binary Tree: All interior nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

Tree Traversal:
Inorder (Left, Root, Right) - useful for sorted BST traversal.
Preorder (Root, Left, Right) - useful for tree reconstruction.
Postorder (Left, Right, Root) - useful for deletion operations.
Level Order - breadth-first traversal
