A trie is a tree-like data structure designed for efficient storage and retrieval of strings, especially for tasks like prefix-based searching. Unlike binary trees or BSTs, which compare entire values,  tries break strings into individual characters and organize them in a way that exploits common prefixes.
can be implemented as an array or hashmap for node.

## characteristics
Each node represents a single character of a string, root is typically empty. 
A path from the root to a node spells out a prefix or full word. Nodes often have a flag (e.g., isEndOfWord) to mark the end of a valid word.
 Each node can have multiple childrenâ€”usually up to the size of the alphabet (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters, or more if you include digits, symbols, etc.). 
 A node could have map or an array to store the children, and a isEndOfWord flag.

## operations
search O(L), where L is the length of the word. Each character is processed in O(1) with a hash map.
insert O(L), where L is the length of the word. Each character is processed in O(1) with a hash map.
prefix-search O(P + N), where P is the prefix length and N is the number of words with that prefix.

## real-time usecases
search on amazon, google. spellcheck, text predictions, code autocomplete on IDEs, IP packet routing, DNS lookups, NLP. 
the tries data are stored typically sharded in-memory datastore (redis, memcache). 
frequently searched items (hot data) are in in-memory datastore and cold data will be in s3, dynamo, cassandra, HFDS.

Standard/Compressed Tries: Google Search autocomplete (compressed for space).
Bitwise Tries: AWS for IP routing.
Suffix Trees: Bioinformatics at companies like Illumina (via partnerships with tech).
Finite State Tries: Intrusion detection at Meta or Microsoft.

## compression techniques.
path compression (Compressed Tries), node compression (bitmaps), and bit-level compression (Succinct Tries) 
and few more but only these are important.
