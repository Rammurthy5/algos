Imagine you are booking a trip. (I've been doing a lot of such imagining since March 2020.) On your favorite travel website, you pick a hotel, some airline tickets, and a rental car, then you enter your credit card information and click "Book!" What happens next? 
You only want to pay the travel website if your choice of hotel, flight, and rental car are all available. Similarly, the companies involved don't want to hold any reservations in your name unless they can be sure that your bank will accept the credit card charges. To realize your trip, multiple independent computer systems need to examine their local information (bank account state, flight schedules, hotel room availability, etc.) and agree that the transaction is safe to perform.

The travel website acts as the transaction coordinator of the two-phase commit. First, it sends a "prepare to commit" message to the hotel, airline, rental agency, and your bank. These messages ask the protocol participants to confirm that they have no objections to the transaction based on their individual information. For example, your airline will confirm that your selected seats are still available — if someone else has booked them in the meantime, the airline will respond to the message with an "abort" command, and the transaction will fail without charging your credit card.

Responses to these "prepare to commit" messages are binding: for example, once your bank says "the transfer is allowed and sufficient funds are available," it can't change its mind at a later time (in practice, at least not until a very long timeout, usually 7–10 days). This is commonly called "authorizing the charge" on your card — you have not been charged yet, but your funds are held in reserve to ensure they remain available.

If your hotel, airline, rental agency, and bank all respond positively to the "prepare to commit" messages, then you know your trip is viable, and the various other parties know that you are able to pay for it. The next step is to send a message to all participants confirming the transaction: your card gets charged, your airline sends you a ticket confirmation, your hotel sends you a room reservation, etc.
